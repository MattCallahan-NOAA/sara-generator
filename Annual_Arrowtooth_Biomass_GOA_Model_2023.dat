#There are three required sections to check or update: Indicator Summary, Indicator Review, and Indicator Data  
#Please fill in the text (surrounded by " ") or data as values in the line after each field marked with a # and capitalized name (e.g., #INTENDED_ESP, the next line should be "Alaska Sablefish") 
#Note that several of the fields below may be static or only change occasionally, please review all fields when submitting the contribution
#Note that all fields are described in the Alaska ESP User Guide, please see [URL] for more details

"AFSC"
#CONTACT - Full name of person to contact with questions regarding the indicator contribution, must be in email format and must match contact in Alaska ESP User Guide

#REGION - Describe the region over which the indicator applies. Please use fisheries management areas where possible. Examples include St. Matthews Blue King Crab Management Area, Central Gulf of Alaska, Eastern Bering Sea.  
"Gulf of Alaska"
#ESR - If the indicator also appears in some form in an Ecosystem Status Report (ESR), select the appropriate ESR. Choices are Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian Islands, Eastern Bering Sea. If the indicator does not appear in an ESR, select Not Applicable.
"NA"
#FREQUENCY - Frequency with which the indicator is updated. Options are annual, sub-annual, multi-annual, or adhoc.
"Annual"

"No"
#INDICATOR_REVIEW ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#DESCRIPTION - Short description of the indicator that will be used in the main ESP document. This has been pre-filled with what was used in last yearâ€™s ESPs. Please make sure this description includes information on the spatial distribution of the indicator and how the data for the indicator are collected. The spatial resolution can be a cell size dimension (e.g., 5 km resolution for gridded data) or area of sampling for a survey (e.g., Shelikof Strait). The data collection method can be brief (e.g., survey name and gear type, satellite sensor and version, stock assessment model output, fishery observer data, community reports, etc.). (Limit to 4000 characters)  
"Arrowtooth flounder total biomass (metric tons) from the most recent stock assessment model, 1977 to present."
#STATUS_TRENDS - Information on the status and trends of the indicator similar to what is produced for an Ecosystem Status Report (ESR) contribution. (Limit to 4000 characters)
"text on status of the arrowtooth total biomass trend"
#FACTORS - Information on the factors that are influencing the status and trends of the indicator similar to what is produced for an Ecosystem Status Report (ESR) contribution. (Limit to 4000 characters)
"text on factors influencing the status and trend"
#IMPLICATIONS - Information on the implications   
"text on implications for fisheries management decisions"
#REFERENCES - Include any full references that are associated with the indicator. This may include data references such as from an ERDDAP webpage or literature cited (plus the DOI where possible). Please also provide the full reference if there is an associated ESR contribution that provides more details on the indicator
