2024,"Annual_Heatwave_GOA_Model","Annual marine heatwave index is calculated from daily sea surface temperatures for 1985 through present from the NOAA NOAA Coral Reef Watch Program. Daily mean sea surface temperature data were processed to obtain the marine heatwave cumulative intensity (MHWCI) (Hobday et al., 2016) value where we defined a heat wave as 5 days or more with daily mean sea surface temperatures greater than the 90th percentile of the January 1985 through December 2015 time series. Spatial resolution is 5 km satellite sea surface temperatures aggregated over the Alaska exclusive economic zone followed by annual summation of a cumulative heatwave index in degree Celsius days.","Marine heatwave events are largely absent for most of the time series at this full Alaska spatial scale. Large events have occured in 1997, 2005, 2014-2016, and 2019. This year continues the trend of no heatwaves since 2021.","Warm years are often associated with El Nino events (1998, 2003, and 2016) and marine heat waves. Cool conditions are related to complex winter balances between heat loss, coastal runoff and stratification (Janout et al., 2010). Additionally, detection of marine heatwaves will depend on the suite of baseline years that are included for the marine heatwave calculation.","Absence of marine heatwaves implies cooler conditions which may impact growth during the early life history stages of sablefish.","Janout, M.
